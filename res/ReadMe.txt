About/Overview            The adventure game takes a dungeon, a labyrinth of caves filled with various riches, with your ultimate goal of making your way through the dungeon, collecting its riches, and reaching its end. As a player, you will be dropped at a random location in the dungeon to start with only knowledge of your cave. Each cave possibly has treasure and can go 1- 4 directions North, South, East, or West. Every dungeon will have at least 1 one to solve it, but the number of ways to solve it can vary. However, along with traveling gathering treasure, you may run into a cave-dwelling monster called an Otyugh. They are solitary smelly creatures that are found throughout the dungeon. You can guarantee one will be at the end of it. Since they are so stinky, their smell can waft through the caves and affect their surrounding caves' smell depending on how close they are and how many of them there are. Lucky for you, you are equipped with a bow and Crooked arrows. To start, you have three arrows, but you can find more traveling throughout the dungeon. The unique thing about these arrows is they will travel freely through tunnels no matter what. If you can hit your mark enough times you can kill the Otyugh. Only when they're dead can you feel safe. When uninjured by arrows, you have no chance of escape and will die immediately. If they are injured, you only have a 50% chance to live when entering a cave with one.       The adventure Games goal is to have you solve the dungeon and make it through the dungeon safely and collect as much as you can along the way. So, we have our dungeon model to represent all the inner workings of the dungeon. Then we can interact with that by asking for various cmds you can do in the dungeon, such as shoot move and pick up. As the state of the dungeon updates, you will hope to solve it and make it out safely.           List of Features     *	A dungeon is created with a specified width and height.    *	A dungeon is created with specified interconnectivity.    *	A dungeon always creates one where they start, and the end is at least five moves apart.    *	A dungeon can wrap, meaning if a player is at (0,0) in a wrapping dungeon and moves    north, they could go to (0, height -1).    *	A dungeon will hold treasure.    *	A player can pick up treasure along the way.    *	They are not required to pick up treasure in a given cave.    *	There is no limit to how much treasure a player can hold.    *	There is no limit to how much a given cave can hold for treasure.    *	The dungeon can provide a deception at any given time. Which provides players treasure,    the cave's treasure, and the directions they can travel. The smell and if it�s a tunnel or not    and if there is a dead monster in it.    *	A cave can hold diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.    *	A cave can have directions north, south, east, or west.    *	If the player reaches the end, they are still allowed to travel around the dungeon more.    *	A 2d grid represents the dungeon.    *	A player will always be dropped at the start of the dungeon.    *	A cave can have 1-4 connections.    *	A cave with two connections is considered a tunnel.    *	Crooked Arrows can be found through the dungeon at the same rate as treasure.    *	Arrows can be found in both caves and tunnels.    *	Players will start with three arrows.    *	In the dungeon, you can find a specified number of Otyughs.    *	There is always an Otyugh in the end cave.    *	Otyughs take two shots to kill.    *	If an Otyughs has been shot and you run into it, you have 50% to escape.    *	If you run into an uninjured Otyughs, you will die immediately.    *	Otyughs are only found in non-Tunnel Caves.    *	If there are one Otyughs 2 moves away, there is a slight smell.    *	If there are more than one Otyughs two moves away, there is a pungent smell.    *	If you are one move away from an Otyughs, there is a pungent smell.    *	If there are no Otyughs within two moves of you, there is no smell.    *	You can shoot an arrow at a distance of 5.    *	Arrows travel freely through tunnels, and they do not count as one of the distances    traveled.    *	Suppose an arrow goes into a tunnel in the east. In the tunnel's exit in the south, the arrow    will go out the south and continue along that direction. Similar for all other variations of    this.    *	Arrows will be stopped if they are in a non-tunnel with no cave exit in the direction the    arrow is currently traveling.    *	The arrows must be exact when making contact with Otyughs. If one is a distance of 1    away and you shoot two, it will not hit its mark.How To Run:    Run the jar file will just run if you use java -jar (File path)    There is a Total of 6 Arguments you must provide in the order described below    a.	Arg1: Width of dungeon        i.	Must be greater than or equal to 6    b.	Arg2: Height of dungeon        i.	Must be greater than or equal to 6    c.	Arg3: Interconnectivity of the dungeon greater than or equal to 0        i.	In the case of a wrapping dungeon max value is (W x H) + 1        ii.	In the case of a Non-Wrapping Dungeon max value is (W � 1) x (H � 1)    d.	Arg4: Wrapping or not        i.	true if wrapping        ii.	false if not wrapping    e.	Arg5: Percentage of caves that will hold treasure/arrows as integer        i.	0-100    f.	Arg6: Number of monsters as integer should be 20% or less of total cave count        i.	Ex: 6x6 has 36 total caves is a max of 7 monstersHow to Use the ProgramEnter: "M" to Move:	In Move you can Enter: "N, S, E, W" are your 4 options    A message will be sent if you enter a move that does not meet those 4 options or    makes it so the player does not progress.	A message will also appear if the play escapes an Otyugh or is eaten by oneEnter: "P" to Pickup:    If there are items to pickup in the dungeon a message will appear telling you what    you picked up.    If there are no items to pick up it will tell you there are no items to pick up and    ask for a new cmd.Enter: "S" to Shoot:	Shoot will require you to Enter a Integer value for the distance of the shot	And to  one "N, S, E, W" are your 4 options	If you fail to give an integer an or a not a move you will get a message    If you fail to enter valid directions or a valid distance you will get an message    form the error that would have been thrownEnter: "Q or q" to to Quit:    If you are not already within an cmd S or M. If you enter q it will quit the game    for youIf you are at the end of the dungeon and enter q or Q it will note that you won.Description of Examples:	For all the example runs I am just playing out my controller by enter the cmds manually myself and playing out the game. So, note whenever I say Move Shoot or Pickup I am referring to the cmd M, S or P and direction similar stuff when defining directions. Since moving is very common I will note that after every move M  is made successfully  the controller appends an updated description. Every time a pickup is called secssfully an updated status of all items is appended.  Run1:    *	Created a Non-Wrapping Dungeon.        1.	6x6 with four connectivity and two monsters    *	Build a Controller with a new System. in and System. out    *	Play Game with the dungeon    *	Controller appends the description stuff    *	Make a move East    *	Controller appends the description stuff    *	Make a move West    *	Make a move South    *	Make a move West    *	Make a move South    *	Make a move East    *	Description now notes there�s a slight smell    *	Make a move East    *	Description now notes there�s a smell close by    *	Make a move East    *	Eaten by a monster Run2:    *	Created a Non-Wrapping Dungeon.        1.	6x6 with four connectivity and two monsters    *	Build a Controller with a new System. in and System. out    *	Play Game with the dungeon    *	Controller appends the description stuff    *	Move south    *	Shoot an arrow east 1    *	Appends there was a howl in the distance    *	Move east    *	Appends you narrowly escaped an Otyugh, and you return to your previous spot    *	Move East    *	Eaten by a monsterRun 3    *	Created a Non-Wrapping Dungeon.        1.	6x6 with four connectivity and two monsters    *	Build a Controller with a new System. in and System. out    *	Play Game with the dungeon    *	Move East    *	Move North    *	Move West    *	Move West    *	Try to Move north but can�t since that is not a valid move    *	Try to Move West but can�t since that is not a valid move    *	Move South    *	Try to Move East but can�t since that is not a valid move    *	Try to Move West but can�t since that is not a valid move    *	Try to Move south but can�t since that is not a valid move    *	Move North    *	Move East    *	Move West    *	Move North    *	Try to Move East but can�t since that is not a valid move    *	Try to Move West but can�t since that is not a valid move    *	Move East    *	Move East    *	Move West    *	Move South    *	Move East    *	Move South    *	Move South    *	Move North    *	Try to Move West but can�t since that is not a valid move    *	Move East    *	Move South    *	Move North    *	Move West    *	Move South    *	Move South    *	Move South    *	Move West    *	Move East    *	Enter Q    *	Appends message about quitting Run 4    *	Created a Non-Wrapping Dungeon.        1.	6x6 with four connectivity and two monsters    *	Build a Controller with a new System. in and System. out    *	Play Game with the dungeon    *	In Cave Pickup Treasure    *	Appends the updated item counts    *	Move South    *	Pickup    *	Move East        1.

So now a player, along with the items they collected, keeps track of the arrows they find in the dungeon. Also, every player automatically starts with three arrows. At the player level, they only can shoot, which increments their arrow count by 1. Since a player can have their location updated to a new cave, they will die immediately if that new cave has an Otyugh in it that is uninjured. If injured, they will have a 50 % chance of going back to the tunnel/Cave they were previously in. The player also keeps track of its active status. If dead, all player functionality stops working. Caves:      Caves have a few added features: they can now contain arrows, valid for both tunnels and caves. For caves and not tunnels, they can now hold Otyughs but only one per cave. Finally, caves can now be assigned smells. There is no rule on what smell is assigned at this level since the interconnectivity of the caves does not matter at this level, only that they can have a scent.  Dungeons:      Dungeons have all the added features explained above and below. The added ruling about these features is that arrows will appear the same percentage as treasure. There will always be a monster in the end cave of the dungeon. The smells of the caves depend on the Otyughs relative to them and the quantity of them. Players can shoot arrows in a designated direction and distance of caves, not tunnels. Arrows will travel freely through them. To kill the monster, it takes two shots, and the length must be exact. Monsters:      Monsters, specifically Otyughs, there were no changes to the initial design them.Controller:      At the controller level, I added a level of abstraction to the cmd structure of an abstract cmd to take in the similar features of the cmds. I also added that cmds would take the appealable and Scanner to verify the passed-in value and post the messages required for each action taken. Enum Changes:      I added a smell Enum and changed the treasure Enum to a Cave Object Enum since arrows are similar to reassure, just slight variations.  Assumptions:    *	That a dungeon has a minimum of 6 x 6 for the setup.    *	A tunnel can't hold treasure.    *	That the start and finish are at least five apart.    *	A player is not required to pick up treasure.    *	There is no Max amount of treasure a player can pick up.    *	If the player reaches the end, they are not required to finish the dungeon.    *	There are only three types of treasure.    *	There are only four directions to travel.    *	There is at least one path from every cave to every other cave.    *	There is always at least one Otyugh in the dungeon, and it is in the end cave.    *	If the player enters a cave with an injured Otyugh and escapes, they go back to the cave    they were previously at.    *	The number of Otyugh is less than or equal to 20% of a total node in the dungeon.    *	If the Otyugh is dead, it does not let off any smell.    *	Arrows travel freely through tunnels.    *	If an arrow makes it into a, have that has an Otyugh, and the arrow cannot continue due    to connection restrictions. Even if it has more to travel, it will hit the Otyugh since there    is nowhere else for it to go.    *	Once you shoot an arrow, you cannot just go and find it in the cave.Limitations     *	If someone wanted a smaller dungeon, that is not possible.    *	There are always only going to be three types of treasure due to it being an enum.    *	There are always going to be four types of directions due to being an enum.    *	A player can't keep track of where they have been.    *	Once a cave has one of its directions set, it cannot be reset.    *	If you don't designate a high enough percent of arrows and too many monsters, the    dungeon may be impossible to solve.    *	There is no way of knowing you killed an Otyugh until you enter a cave with a dead one.    *	The number of monsters is finite.    *	Since smell is an Enum, you can't just add a new smell.    *	The only way to quit the dungeon and collect everything is to win.    *	You cannot pick up items in a cave one by one. It is an all-in-one-go situation.Citations:    Also met during office hours:   - Professor Freifeld for a Design Meeting
